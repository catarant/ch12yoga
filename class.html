        <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
        <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side
            with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat
            and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use your
            arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position.
            Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
